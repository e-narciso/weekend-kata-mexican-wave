        The wave (known as the Mexican wave in the English-speaking world
        outside North America) is an example of metachronal rhythm achieved in a
        packed stadium when successive groups of spectators briefly stand, yell,
        and raise their arms. Immediately upon stretching to full height, the
        spectator returns to the usual seated position.

        <p>
          The result is a wave of standing spectators that travels through the
          crowd, even though individual spectators never move away from their
          seats. In many large arenas the crowd is seated in a contiguous
          circuit all the way around the sport field, and so the wave is able to
          travel continuously around the arena; in discontiguous seating
          arrangements, the wave can instead reflect back and forth through the
          crowd. When the gap in seating is narrow, the wave can sometimes pass
          through it. Usually only one wave crest will be present at any given
          time in an arena, although simultaneous, counter-rotating waves have
          been produced. (Source

        In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a
        string into a Mexican Wave. You will be passed a string and you must
        return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person
        standing up.
